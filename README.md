Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

In this project, I've developed a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. By analyzing patterns in customer purchasing behavior, one can group similar customers together, enabling the retail store to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to specific customer segments. The algorithm clusters customers into diverse groups based on similarities in their purchasing habits, allowing the store to gain insights into different customer preferences and behaviors. Through this project, my aim was to optimize marketing efforts, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive business growth by better understanding and catering to the diverse needs of our customer base.
